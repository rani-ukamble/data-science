For much of that time, he has investigated the histories of living and extinct species in the Holarctic – a region from Europe across Asia into North America – between 100 and 10 thousand years ago. Recently, his major focus has been on the role of adaptation and migration in the human settlement of the British Isles.","In 2018, biomolecular archaeologist Ian Barnes' team at the Natural History Museum in London ascertained that Cheddar Man—the oldest near-complete human skeleton discovered in the British Isles—had dark skin and light eyes. Their findings challenged the views that many groups had long held about Britain's racial heritage. In this talk, Barnes describes how biomolecular archaeology is transforming the way we think about racial migration in prehistoric times.","22,162","history,technology,surveillance"
